Setting Up a New Project
Without any configuration, ZUnit finds tests by recursively searching a directory named tests within the folder in which it is executed. To get started without any configuration, create a file named tests/example.zunit containing your first test.

If you’d rather not use a test directory, you can place the files anywhere, and run ZUnit by passing it a file or list of files to execute.

#!/usr/bin/env zunit

@test 'Example test' {
  assert 'true' same_as 'false'
}
Initialising a New Project
For more advanced usage, ZUnit has a handy init command, which will create ZUnit’s directory structure and generate a .zunit.yml configuration file and an example test for you. Just run zunit init in your project’s root directory.

If you plan to test your project with the Travis CI service, you can generate an example .travis.yml file by running zunit init --travis

You can find a full explanation of all of ZUnit’s configuration options in the configuration docs.
