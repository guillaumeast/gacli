Reporting
ZUnit is able to generate detailed reports for tests runs, which are enabled by passing options to ZUnit.

To enable reporting, the output directory must be configured in .zunit.yml. See the configuration docs for details.

Passing --output-text will generate a TAP compatible text report in tests/_output/output.txt.
