# Installed tools record: /.data/config/installed.tools.yaml

# This file is runtime generated by GACLI
# All read/write operations are delegated to parser.zsh

# Used by:
#   - update.zsh    → checks if update is due by comparing installed.tools content with runtime dependencies values
#   - update.zsh    → saves installed formulae, caks and modules after each update (by calling brew_check and modules_check for each f, c and m)
