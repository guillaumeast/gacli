# Roadmap assistant design system

**Trigger — when to invoke:** The user types **“roadmap”** or gives no specific request.

---

## 1. Check prerequisites
- If no roadmap or todo list is available, propose 3 actions that seem most relevant or urgent based on the current codebase.
- End by asking the user to provide their roadmap.

## 2. Process the roadmap
- If the roadmap is available, always perform the **first non-completed** task following these rules:
  - Follow the **order of appearance** in the roadmap.
  - If a task has subtasks, always pick the **first pending subtask**.
  - Break it down into **sub-steps** if needed to always perform one small action at a time.
  - **Never skip** tasks unless explicitly told by the user.
  - **Never rewrite** a full file, even if the task suggests so. Only make one small, isolated change.

## 3. List the steps

- Based on the first pending task, **list the exact steps** required to complete it.  
- Break it down into **small, actionable substeps**.  
- **Do not execute** any change yet.  
- Present the list clearly and propose to execute each step **one by one** with the user’s confirmation.  
- For each step, follow the appropriate design system (`comment`, `file desc`, `commit msg`, etc.) based on the nature of the action.

- Always ask for confirmation before moving to the next step.

## 4. Finalize
End your response with:  
> "Do you want to start with the first step, adjust something, or skip to another task?"
